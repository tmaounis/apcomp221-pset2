# apcomp221-pset2
What's included:
    • A Python Notebook file, cleaning_data.ipynb, which contains all the code required for questions 1-3 on the pset. It also contains various testing statements within the file. 
    • The dataset, dirty_sample_small.csv, is NOT included. We choose to not include large datasets on github as it often complains. The dataset should be in the directory directly outside of the directory with the code to be imported correctly. 

Running the code:
    • Ensure that the dataset is in the directory directly outside of the directory with the code.
    • We recommend Jupyter Notebooks to run the Python notebook files.
    • Run through cleaning_data.ipynb file line by line. Shift+enter executes a code block in Jupyter Notebooks. 
    
Testing:
    • There is no seperate file for testing.
